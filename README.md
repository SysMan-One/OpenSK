is not ready for public consumption.

General Notes
-------------
Because this API is very experimental, there may be large periods of inactivity
on the public repo. The workflow looks like this:

1. Experiment with API changes locally, commit to a private repo as-needed.

2. When a comfortable milestone has been hit, push the squashed commit public.

3. Dogfood public commit as main OpenSK driver, test API flexibility.

Repeat.

This process is sometimes lengthy, especially when enabling new features that
require deep changes within the API. We saw this happen for 0.0.12 commit, which
took many months to re-architect, test, and validate.
